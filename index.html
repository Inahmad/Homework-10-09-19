        <h2>About</h2>

        <img src="./assets/images/IMG_1098.jpg " alt="" class="picture">

        <p>I was born in northern Virginia, about 20 minutes south of Washington D.C in a town called Fairfax. I have
            lived in a total of 3 states
            I have lived in 3 states through out my short life, those states being Virginia, California, and North
            Carolina.
            All of the states have many beautiful landmarks and rich history that make them all very special.
            I have traveled afar and enjoy very much, seeing all the wonders of the world. I have had an unsual path
            that has lead me to coding
            We many times do not understand how life leads us to a particlar place but we learn to accept it and embrace
            it in our journey.
            I am excited to begin this venture and even more excited to continue to tread this path to become a web
            develper.</p>
